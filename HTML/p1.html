      <h2>What is Hacking?</h2>
      <p>Hacking is the activity of identifying weaknesses in a computer system or a network to exploit
        the security to gain access to personal data or business data. An example of computer hacking can be: using a
        password cracking algorithm to gain access to a computer system.<br>

        Computers have become mandatory to run a successful businesses. It is not enough to have isolated computers
        systems; they need to be networked to facilitate communication with external businesses. This exposes them to
        the outside world and hacking. System hacking means using computers to commit fraudulent acts such as fraud,
        privacy invasion, stealing corporate/personal data, etc. Cyber crimes cost many organizations millions of
        dollars every year. Businesses need to protect themselves against such attacks.</p>

      <p class="subtxt">Before we learn hacking, let’s look at the introduction of hacking and some of the most commonly
        used terminologies in the world of hacking.</p>
      <h2 id="terminologie">Who is a Hacker?</h2>
      <p>A Hacker is a person who finds and exploits the weakness in computer systems and/or networks to gain access.
        Hackers are usually skilled computer programmers with knowledge of computer security.</p>
      <h2 id="typehack">Types of Hackers</h2>
      <p>Hackers are classified according to the intent of their actions. The following list classifies types of hackers
        according to their intent:</p>

            <span>Ethical Hacker (White hat):</span> A security hacker who gains access to systems with a view to fix the
             identified weaknesses. They may also perform penetration Testing and vulnerability assessments.

      </ol>
      <h2 id="ethack">What is Ethical Hacking?</h2>
      <p>Ethical Hacking is identifying weakness in computer systems and/or computer networks and coming with countermeasures that protect the weaknesses. Ethical hackers must abide by the following rules.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Get <span>written permission</span> from the owner of the computer system and/or computer network before hacking.</li>
        <li><span>Protect the privacy of the organization</span> been hacked.</li>
        <li><span>Transparently report</span> all the identified weaknesses in the computer system to the organization.</li>
        <li>Inform hardware and software vendors of the <span>identified weaknesses.</span></li>
      </ul>
      <h2 id="legality">Legality of Ethical Hacking</h2>
      <p><span>Ethical Hacking is legal if the hacker abides by the rules stipulated in the above section on the definition of ethical hacking.</span> The International Council of E-Commerce Consultants (EC-Council) provides a certification program that tests individual’s skills. Those who pass the examination are awarded with certificates. The certificates are supposed to be renewed after some time.</p>
